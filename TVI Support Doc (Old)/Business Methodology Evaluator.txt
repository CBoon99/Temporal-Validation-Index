Business Methodology Evaluator
Product Specification v1.0
Powered by the TVI Cultural Lens
Tagline: "Separate methodologies that stick from fads that fade"
________________


EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Problem
Management consultants, executives, and strategy teams face a critical question daily: "Should we implement this methodology?" Current decision-making relies on:
* Consultant recommendations (biased by what they sell)
* Hype cycle positioning (Gartner, trend reports)
* Peer adoption (FOMO-driven)
* Gut feeling (no data backing)
Result: Companies waste millions implementing fads (Holacracy, Radical Candor) that fade within 2-3 years while proven methodologies (Agile, Lean, SMART Goals) continue delivering value for decades.
The Solution
Business Methodology Evaluator: Data-driven tool that scores methodologies by True Viral Impact (TVI) - their actual staying power and cultural adoption across industries.
Key Innovation: First tool to measure methodology longevity using cultural saturation framework, revealing:
* Which methodologies endure vs fade
* 99% staying power decline in modern methodologies
* Predictive indicators of lasting value
The Market
Primary: Management consultants ($250B global market) Secondary: Strategy executives, innovation teams, HR leaders Pain Point: Avoid implementing fads, focus resources on proven frameworks
Revenue Model
* Pro Tier: $149/month per user (methodology database access)
* Enterprise: $2,500/month per organization (unlimited users + API)
* Consulting: $15K-$25K custom methodology evaluation
* Year 1 Target: 100 Pro users + 10 Enterprise = $250K ARR

PRODUCT OVERVIEW
What It Does
Core Function: Input: Business methodology name (e.g., "Holacracy", "OKRs", "Six Sigma") Output: TVI score + staying power analysis + implementation recommendation
Key Outputs:
1. TVI Score (0-100+): Quantified staying power
2. Classification: Industry Standard / Transformative / Influential / Noticed / Ephemeral
3. Staying Power Prediction: Will it endure 5+ years?
4. Benchmark Comparison: vs established methodologies
5. Implementation Risk Assessment: High/Medium/Low fade risk
6. ROI Timeline: When methodology pays off (if it sticks)
How It Works
Step 1: User Input
* Methodology name
* Optional: Industry context, implementation timeline
Step 2: TVI Calculation
* Retrieve pre-calculated TVI from database
* OR calculate on-the-fly for new/emerging methodologies
* Apply industry-specific adjustments if needed
Step 3: Analysis Generation
* TVI score interpretation
* Comparison to benchmarks (Agile TVI 66.6, SMART Goals TVI 74.2)
* Risk assessment based on staying power data
* Implementation recommendations
Step 4: Report Delivery
* Interactive dashboard
* PDF export for client presentations
* Benchmark charts

COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS
Current "Competitors" (Not Really)
Gartner Hype Cycle:
* What they do: Position technologies on hype curve
* Limitation: Qualitative, expensive ($15K+ reports), tech-only
* Our advantage: Quantitative TVI, affordable, all business methodologies
McKinsey/BCG Reports:
* What they do: Strategy consulting, trend reports
* Limitation: Generic, expensive consulting, no tool
* Our advantage: Self-service tool, data-driven, immediate access
Books/Blogs:
* What they do: Methodology descriptions, opinions
* Limitation: No comparison data, no staying power analysis
* Our advantage: Objective scores, cross-methodology comparison
Reality: No direct competitor exists.
We're creating a new category: Business Methodology Intelligence

RISKS & MITIGATION
Risk 1: "TVI scores are subjective"
Mitigation:
* Publish methodology transparently
* Show calculation inputs
* Invite validation/challenges
* Update scores based on new data
Risk 2: "Database too small initially"
Mitigation:
* Start with top 50 most-searched methodologies
* Add 5-10 new ones monthly
* Crowdsource requests (users vote on additions)
* Custom evaluation service fills gaps
Risk 3: "Consultants might resist"
Mitigation:
* Position as tool FOR consultants, not against
* "Impress clients with data-backed recommendations"
* Testimonials from early adopter consultants
* Commission/referral program
Risk 4: "Low initial traffic"
Mitigation:
* Content marketing (viral TVI insights)
* Direct outreach to consultants
* Product Hunt launch
* Speaking at conferences

WHY THIS WILL WORK
1. Real Pain Point: Consultants/executives waste millions on fads
2. Novel Data: Nobody has TVI scores for methodologies
3. Clear Value: "Don't implement Holacracy (TVI 0.3), use Agile (TVI 66.6)"
4. Immediate Use: Use in client presentation tomorrow
5. High Willingness to Pay: B2B, saves millions in bad decisions
6. Defensible: First mover, building canonical database
7. Scalable: SaaS model, API, consulting services
8. You Can Build It: Code skills + domain knowledge + speed
