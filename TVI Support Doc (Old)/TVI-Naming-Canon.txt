TVI System (Canonical) — Naming Reference
-----------------------------------------
Core metric: TVI (Temporal Validation Index).

Component metrics (apply everywhere):
* CSI — Contextual Saturation Index (includes A-Factor + Cross-Context Coefficient C).
* TVS — Temporal Validation Score (Persistence × Resurfacing × Legacy).
* SRC — Structural Resistance Coefficient (era difficulty).
* A-Factor — Audience Multiplication Factor (account churn / audience turnover).
* C — Cross-Context Coefficient (escape velocity beyond origin).

Domain variants:
* Viral media: TVI.
* AI datasets: TDIS (Temporal Dataset Impact Score) reuses CSI/TVS/SRC with dataset-specific inputs.
* Business methods: TVI-B (Business TVI).
* Investments: ISPS (Investment Staying Power Score).

Mental model (one line):
CSI shows how loud it was. TVS shows how long it lasted. SRC shows how hard the era was. TVI shows how real it is.

Use this as the naming authority for all supporting docs and calculators.
