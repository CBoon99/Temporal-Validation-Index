  <!-- CONTENT -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>When a License Is Required</h2>
    <p>A commercial license is required for any use of TVI where outputs inform business decisions, client work, or operational systems. Specifically:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Investment decisions:</strong> When TVI scores inform capital allocation, portfolio management, or investment analysis</li>
      <li><strong>Brand / media / marketing analytics:</strong> When TVI is used for brand impact measurement, media valuation, marketing effectiveness analysis, or client-facing analytics</li>
      <li><strong>Client deliverables:</strong> When TVI analysis is included in reports, presentations, or deliverables provided to clients or external stakeholders</li>
      <li><strong>Internal decision systems:</strong> When TVI is integrated into internal analytics, dashboards, or decision-support systems that inform operational choices</li>
      <li><strong>Dashboards, pipelines, automation:</strong> When TVI is embedded in automated workflows, data pipelines, or dashboard systems</li>
      <li><strong>API or batch usage:</strong> When TVI is accessed programmatically, used for bulk analysis, or integrated into other systems via API</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Demonstrative use (public calculator, evaluation access) does not require a license. Any operational, client-facing, or decision-informing use requires commercial licensing.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Commercial Use Cases</h2>
    <p>TVI is designed for integration into existing analytical workflows and platforms. Primary commercial use cases include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Investment & research firms:</strong> Downside protection, structural validation, and temporal advantage analysis for portfolio management</li>
      <li><strong>Brand and marketing analytics providers:</strong> Long-term brand impact measurement, cultural measurement, and media effectiveness analysis beyond short-term engagement metrics</li>
      <li><strong>Media intelligence companies:</strong> Content valuation, cultural persistence analysis, and long-horizon trend identification</li>
      <li><strong>Cultural analytics platforms:</strong> Temporal validation layers for content recommendation, curation, and archival prioritization</li>
      <li><strong>AI / data organizations:</strong> Dataset durability assessment, benchmark staying power evaluation, and training data selection</li>
      <li><strong>Strategy & advisory firms:</strong> Methodology validation, framework durability analysis, and long-term strategic planning support</li>
    </ul>
    <p>TVI functions as a validation layer and measurement standard, not a standalone product. It is designed for integration into existing analytical infrastructure or strategic acquisition by established metrics providers.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Licensed Access (Conceptual)</h2>
    <p>Commercial licensing provides decision-grade access to TVI. Licensed access includes (conceptually):</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Decision-grade outputs:</strong> Validated, calibrated TVI scores appropriate for operational use, investment analysis, and client deliverables</li>
      <li><strong>Batch analysis:</strong> Capabilities for analyzing multiple entities, portfolios, or datasets at scale</li>
      <li><strong>API access:</strong> Programmatic access to TVI calculation and analysis (conceptual—specific implementation depends on integration requirements)</li>
      <li><strong>Internal or client-facing rights:</strong> Usage rights for internal decision systems or client-facing analytics and deliverables</li>
      <li><strong>Optional white-label deployment:</strong> Ability to deploy TVI under your brand for client-facing applications (subject to agreement)</li>
      <li><strong>Advisory support:</strong> Optional consultation on TVI interpretation, integration, and best practices (subject to agreement)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Specific licensing terms, access levels, and integration capabilities are determined through commercial discussion based on use case, scale, and integration requirements.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>IP & Ownership</h2>
    <div class="highlight-box">
      <p><strong>TVI is proprietary.</strong> The Temporal Validation Index framework, including its calculation methodology, era coefficients, domain-specific adjustments, classification thresholds, and all related analytical logic, is proprietary to BoonMind Analytics.</p>
      <p><strong>Patent applications in preparation.</strong> TVI is protected by patent applications in preparation. Licensing does not transfer IP ownership unless explicitly agreed in writing.</p>
      <p><strong>Licensing ≠ ownership.</strong> A commercial license grants usage rights for defined purposes and scopes. It does not transfer ownership of the TVI framework, methodology, or IP.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Any use of TVI beyond demonstrative evaluation requires explicit licensing. Reverse engineering, replication, or unauthorized use of TVI methodology is prohibited.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Strategic Positioning</h2>
    <p>TVI is positioned as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>A measurement standard, not a dashboard:</strong> TVI provides a validated framework for temporal validation, designed to become a reference standard rather than a user-facing product</li>
      <li><strong>A validation layer, not a growth metric:</strong> TVI measures durability and persistence, complementing (not replacing) engagement and growth metrics</li>
      <li><strong>Designed for integration or acquisition:</strong> TVI is structured for integration into existing analytical platforms or strategic acquisition by established metrics and analytics providers</li>
    </ul>
    <p>TVI is not positioned as a standalone SaaS product, consumer tool, or growth-focused startup. It is an analytical asset designed for strategic integration.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Engagement Flow</h2>
    <p>Commercial engagement follows a structured flow:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Assessment of TVI's relevance and fit through evaluation access and materials</li>
      <li><strong>Licensing:</strong> Commercial discussion and agreement on licensing terms, scope, and access levels</li>
      <li><strong>Deployment or Strategic Integration:</strong> Implementation of licensed access, API integration, or strategic integration into existing platforms</li>
    </ol>
    <p>For strategic acquisition discussions, the flow may differ and is handled through direct engagement with BoonMind Analytics leadership.</p>
