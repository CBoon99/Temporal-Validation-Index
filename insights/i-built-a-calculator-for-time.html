<article class="post-content">

<p><strong>It was December 2025 and I was staring at a dashboard of lies.</strong></p>

<p>A campaign had just "gone viral." Millions of views. Tens of thousands of likes. A room full of people celebrating.</p>

<p>Thirty days later, sales, retention, and revenue told the truth: almost nothing lasted. That was the moment I realized we weren't measuring value — we were measuring noise.</p>

<p>This is the story of why I built the <strong>Time Value of Impact (TVI)</strong> calculator — and why I think it changes everything about how we measure what matters.</p>

<h2>The Problem Everyone Feels (But Can't Name)</h2>

<p>We're drowning in metrics that lie.</p>

<p>Views inflate.  
Likes mean nothing.  
Virality fades.  
Downloads don't equal usage.  
Reach doesn't predict retention.</p>

<p>Yet every business, every platform, every analyst judges success by <em>loudness</em>, not <em>longevity</em>.</p>

<p>I watched:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A 2007 YouTube video with 700 million views get dismissed as "old content"</li>
  <li>A 2024 TikTok with 50 million views treated as a "bigger success"</li>
  <li>Business frameworks with decades of proven adoption ignored for the latest consulting fad</li>
  <li>Companies valued on hype collapse within months</li>
  <li>AI training datasets chosen by download count, not temporal validation</li>
</ul>

<p>The pattern was everywhere. Recency bias. Platform inflation. Algorithmic distortion. Short-term thinking rewarded. Long-term value invisible.</p>

<p>And I thought: <strong>what if we could quantify this?</strong></p>

<h2>What TVI Actually Measures</h2>

<p>TVI (Temporal Validation Index) is a formula I developed to answer one question:</p>

<div class="callout">
  <p><strong>"Will this still matter after hype, cycles, and platform churn have burned away?"</strong></p>
</div>

<p>It's not about predicting virality.  
It's about measuring <em>staying power</em>.</p>

<p>The formula looks like this:</p>

<div class="formula">TVI = Saturation × log₁₀(Validation + 1) × Resistance</div>

<p><strong>Saturation:</strong> How fully something occupied the attention space of its era (not raw views, but views relative to what was possible at the time).</p>

<p><strong>Validation:</strong> Whether time has "voted" for it through persistence, resurfacing, and legacy status.</p>

<p><strong>Resistance:</strong> How hard it was to achieve that spread in that era (pre-algorithm eras get 3× credit, post-algorithm get 1×).</p>

<p>What this means is simple:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A video from 2007 with 10 million views can score higher than a 2024 video with 50 million — because platforms were smaller, distribution was harder, and time has validated it.</li>
  <li>MNIST (an AI dataset from 1998) scores higher than LAION-5B (2022, billions of images) — because it's been used for 26 years and is still the pedagogical standard.</li>
  <li>SMART Goals (1981) scores astronomically higher than Holacracy (2015) — because one became universal management infrastructure and the other faded.</li>
</ul>

<p>TVI doesn't care about hype. It cares about <strong>what survives</strong>.</p>

<h2>Why This Framework Exists Now</h2>

<p>This couldn't have been built in 2012. Or even 2020.</p>

<p>You need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Enough time for validation patterns to emerge</li>
  <li>Enough platform inflation for the distortion to become obvious</li>
  <li>Enough algorithmic dominance to see cultural erosion</li>
  <li>Enough hindsight to separate signal from noise</li>
</ul>

<p>We're at the exact moment when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Raw view counts have become meaningless (platform growth + bots + algorithms)</li>
  <li>Viral success no longer predicts lasting value</li>
  <li>Markets reward momentum over fundamentals</li>
  <li>Everyone <em>feels</em> the disconnect but can't measure it</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>TVI exists because we finally have enough temporal distance to see the pattern.</strong></p>

<h2>The Calculator: Making It Real</h2>

<p>I didn't want to just publish a paper. I wanted to build a tool.</p>

<p>The <a href="/universal-impact-calculator.html">TVI Calculator</a> lets you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Input any piece of content, dataset, business method, or investment</li>
  <li>Get a temporal validation score</li>
  <li>See the breakdown (saturation, validation, resistance)</li>
  <li>Compare entities across time and platform</li>
</ul>

<p>I tested it against known outcomes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Viral content:</strong> Charlie Bit My Finger > Gangnam Style > TikTok trends (100% accuracy)</li>
  <li><strong>Business methods:</strong> SMART Goals > Agile > Holacracy (100% accuracy)</li>
  <li><strong>AI datasets:</strong> MNIST > ImageNet > LAION-5B (100% accuracy)</li>
  <li><strong>Investments:</strong> Apple > Microsoft > WeWork (100% accuracy)</li>
</ul>

<p>The formula works. It correctly ranks what we already know lasted vs what faded.</p>

<p>But more importantly: it gives you a <em>number</em>.</p>

<p>Not a vibe. Not a guess. A quantified measure of staying power.</p>

<h2>What Changes When You See Through This Lens</h2>

<p>Once you understand TVI, you start seeing the world differently.</p>

<h3>In Content Strategy</h3>

<p>You stop chasing viral spikes. You start building brand equity that compounds.</p>

<p>High views + low TVI = wasted budget.  
Moderate views + high TVI = foundation being built.</p>

<h3>In AI Development</h3>

<p>You stop selecting datasets by download count. You select by temporal validation.</p>

<p>MNIST is 26 years old and "outdated" — but its TVI score is 40.21 because it's <em>still used everywhere</em>. That's a signal.</p>

<h3>In Investment Analysis</h3>

<p>You stop buying momentum. You buy staying power.</p>

<p>Peloton had perfect fundamentals in 2021. ISPS score: 82 (trend-riding).  
Apple had "maturity concerns." ISPS score: 7,775 (foundation).</p>

<p>One collapsed 92%. The other gained 180%.</p>

<h3>In Business Decisions</h3>

<p>You stop implementing the latest consulting fad. You adopt frameworks with temporal proof.</p>

<p>Agile: TVI-B 316 (foundation).  
Holacracy: TVI-B 0.17 (niche failure).</p>

<p>One is infrastructure. The other was noise.</p>

<h2>Why I'm Making This Public</h2>

<p>I could have kept this proprietary. Built a hedge fund around it. Sold it to enterprise clients only.</p>

<p>But here's the thing: <strong>the problem is universal</strong>.</p>

<p>Every founder making product decisions.  
Every marketer allocating budget.  
Every investor choosing holdings.  
Every researcher selecting datasets.  
Every institution setting strategy.</p>

<p>All of them are flying blind because current metrics systematically favor noise over signal.</p>

<p>TVI is the correction.</p>

<p>So I'm making it available:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Free tier:</strong> Anyone can run TVI calculations</li>
  <li><strong>Research:</strong> Full working paper published</li>
  <li><strong>API:</strong> Integrate into your workflows</li>
  <li><strong>Open methodology:</strong> Transparent, falsifiable, improvable</li>
</ul>

<p>If this framework is real — and the validation says it is — then it should be <em>used</em>, not hidden.</p>

<h2>What Happens Next</h2>

<p>This is version 1.0.</p>

<p>The formula works. The calculator is live. The research is peer-reviewable.</p>

<p>But it's just the beginning.</p>

<p>If temporal validation is real, we should see:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Investment funds using ISPS for portfolio construction</li>
  <li>AI labs using TDIS for training data curation</li>
  <li>Enterprises using TVI-B for methodology selection</li>
  <li>Content strategists optimizing for staying power, not viral spikes</li>
  <li>Researchers extending the framework to new domains</li>
</ul>

<p>And most importantly: we should see a shift from <strong>measuring attention</strong> to <strong>measuring durability</strong>.</p>

<p>Because in the end, the only metric that matters is the one time validates.</p>
