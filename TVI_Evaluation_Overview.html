    <h2>What TVI Is</h2>
    <p>TVI (Temporal Validation Index) is a proprietary analytical framework for measuring long-term impact, persistence, and structural durability across cultural content, datasets, business methodologies, and investments.</p>
    <p>Unlike short-horizon engagement metrics that measure attention, TVI measures what survives. It quantifies temporal validation—the degree to which something becomes a structural foundation rather than passing noise. TVI distinguishes signal from noise by applying time as the ultimate validator: what persists after hype, cycles, and platform churn has burned away.</p>
    <p>The framework operates on the principle that durability is measurable, and that structural resistance—the difficulty of spreading in a given era—correlates with long-term value. TVI adjusts for era effects, saturation dynamics, and validation patterns to produce a single index that answers: "Will this still matter after visibility fades?"</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Purpose of Evaluation Access</h2>
    <p>Evaluation access exists to enable organizations to assess TVI's relevance and fit for their analytical needs. It provides insight-focused exposure to TVI's approach, outputs, and interpretive frameworks without granting production or commercial usage rights.</p>
    <p>Evaluation is designed for internal assessment: understanding how TVI might inform decision-making, where it aligns with existing analytical workflows, and whether it addresses specific measurement challenges. It is not a trial period for production use, nor does it imply any commitment to licensing.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>What Evaluation Access Includes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Demonstrative tools:</strong> Access to public calculator and evaluation-grade interfaces that illustrate TVI's analytical approach</li>
      <li><strong>Higher-resolution insight views:</strong> Pattern-level analysis showing how TVI distinguishes durable signals from temporary noise across domains</li>
      <li><strong>Limited multi-entity comparison:</strong> Comparative analysis capabilities for evaluating relative temporal validation across entities within the same domain</li>
      <li><strong>Interpretive summaries:</strong> Pattern-level outputs and summaries that explain TVI classifications and their implications</li>
      <li><strong>Framework documentation:</strong> High-level methodology descriptions, use case examples, and validation evidence</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All evaluation outputs are conceptual and illustrative. They demonstrate TVI's analytical approach without exposing computation logic or enabling replication.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>What Evaluation Access Does NOT Include</h2>
    <div class="highlight-box">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>No formula disclosure:</strong> The proprietary TVI calculation formula, component weightings, and normalization logic are not provided</li>
        <li><strong>No weights or normalization logic:</strong> Era coefficients, domain-specific adjustments, and classification thresholds remain confidential</li>
        <li><strong>No raw datasets:</strong> Underlying data used for validation or calibration is not shared</li>
        <li><strong>No exports for client or investment use:</strong> Evaluation outputs cannot be used in client deliverables, investment decisions, or external reporting</li>
        <li><strong>No API, batch, or automation:</strong> Programmatic access, bulk analysis, or integration capabilities are not included</li>
        <li><strong>No redistribution:</strong> Evaluation materials and outputs cannot be shared, published, or redistributed without explicit permission</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Demonstrative vs Decision-Grade Use</h2>
    <p>It is critical to distinguish between demonstrative and decision-grade usage:</p>
    <p><strong>Demonstrative use</strong> (public calculator + evaluation access): Outputs are illustrative, designed for pattern recognition and long-horizon comparison. They demonstrate TVI's analytical approach but are not licensed for operational decision-making, investment analysis, client deliverables, or any use where TVI scores inform business outcomes.</p>
    <p><strong>Decision-grade use</strong> (licensed access): Licensed outputs are validated, calibrated, and appropriate for operational use. They include full formula access, custom domain configurations, API endpoints, and commercial usage rights. Decision-grade usage requires a commercial license.</p>
    <p>Evaluation access provides demonstrative outputs only. Any use of TVI for decision-making, client work, or operational systems requires commercial licensing.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Evaluation Terms</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Time-boxed:</strong> Evaluation access is provided for a defined assessment period, typically 30-60 days</li>
      <li><strong>Non-transferable:</strong> Access is granted to the requesting organization and cannot be transferred or shared</li>
      <li><strong>No rights granted:</strong> Evaluation does not grant any commercial usage rights, licensing rights, or IP rights beyond the scope of internal assessment</li>
      <li><strong>Confidentiality expectation:</strong> Evaluation materials and outputs are provided in confidence and should be treated as confidential</li>
      <li><strong>Patent applications in preparation:</strong> TVI is a proprietary framework with patent applications in preparation. Evaluation does not imply any IP transfer or licensing commitment</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
    <p>If evaluation access is of interest, the engagement flow is:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Contact:</strong> Initial inquiry and use case discussion</li>
      <li><strong>Scope:</strong> Definition of evaluation parameters and assessment objectives</li>
      <li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Provision of evaluation access and materials</li>
      <li><strong>Commercial discussion:</strong> If evaluation indicates fit, discussion of licensing terms and commercial access (if relevant)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Evaluation access is provided at no cost for qualified organizations. There is no obligation to proceed to commercial licensing.</p>
