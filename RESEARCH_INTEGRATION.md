### 7. /research/speculative.html - The Religion (Contained) ✅
**Purpose:** Creative exploration, clearly labeled

**Header warning:**
⚠️ "These sections use the language of physics and mathematics metaphorically. They are intended for intuition-building and creative exploration, not literal physical claims."

**Content (from Paper Appendix B):**
- Schrödinger's Meme (superposition metaphor)
- Cultural Planck Constant (ħ꜀ ≈ 15 min)
- Christoffel Symbols of Attention (curved meaning space)
- Bell Inequalities (cultural entanglement)
- Observational Evidence (tongue-in-cheek: Shakespeare Bose-Einstein condensation, disco Anderson localization, Greek philosophy topological protection)
- Path Integral Formulation (sum over histories)
- Why Include This Appendix? (creative frameworks, spectrum of rigor)

**Visual distinction:** Purple accent instead of cyan, yellow warning banner

**Tone:** Playful but sophisticated, "mathematical poetry"

## 🎯 Strategic Positioning

### What This Achieves

**Credibility:**
- Academic rigor visible
- Published methodology
- Peer-reviewable claims
- Transparent validation

**Defensibility:**
- IP protection through publication
- Prior art established
- Methodology documented
- Scientific foundation

**Conversion:**
- Researchers become users
- Universities adopt for teaching
- Funds use for analysis
- Press coverage ("new framework")

**SEO:**
- "temporal validation framework" ownership

## 💡 Key Differentiators

### vs Other "Research" Pages
Most SaaS "research" pages are:
- Marketing disguised as research
- Invented case studies
- No actual methodology
- No peer-reviewable claims

- Verifiable results
- Published methodology
- Open to critique
- Citable work

### This Matters Because
- Enterprises need justification for tool adoption
- Researchers need reproducible methods
- Investors need evidence-based claims
- Press needs credible sources
