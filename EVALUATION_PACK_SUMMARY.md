# TVI Evaluation Pack - Implementation Summary

## What Was Created

### 1. TVI_Evaluation_Overview.html
**Purpose:** Evaluation document for organizations assessing TVI before commercial discussion.

**Content Structure:**
- Title page with proprietary, patent-pending positioning
- What TVI Is (conceptual explanation, no formula details)
- Purpose of Evaluation Access
- What Evaluation Access Includes (demonstrative tools, insights, comparisons)
- What Evaluation Access Does NOT Include (explicitly states no formula, weights, or IP disclosure)
- Demonstrative vs Decision-Grade Use (clear distinction)
- Evaluation Terms (time-boxed, non-transferable, no rights granted)
- Next Steps (Contact → Scope → Evaluation → Commercial)

**Tone:** Calm, authoritative, research-grade, commercially serious

**IP Protection:** No formulas, weights, coefficients, or computation logic exposed. Only conceptual descriptions of what TVI measures and how evaluation works.

### 2. TVI_Commercial_Licensing_Notes.html
**Purpose:** Strategic document for serious commercial or strategic partners.

**Content Structure:**
- When a License Is Required (investment, brand analytics, client deliverables, etc.)
- Commercial Use Cases (investment firms, brand analytics, media intelligence, etc.)
- Licensed Access (conceptual description - no implementation details)
- IP & Ownership (proprietary, patent-pending, licensing ≠ ownership)
- Strategic Positioning (standard, not dashboard; validation layer, not growth metric; designed for integration/acquisition)
- Engagement Flow (Evaluation → Licensing → Deployment/Integration)

**Tone:** Strategic, defensive of IP, integration-focused, acquisition-ready

**IP Protection:** No formulas, weights, or computation logic exposed. Only describes when licensing is required and what licensed access conceptually includes.

## Site Integration

**Location:** Added minimal reference in the "Commercial Use & Licensing" section of `universal-impact-calculator.html`

**Text Added:** "Evaluation materials available on request." (appears in the "Next Steps" callout box)

**Implementation:**
- No download buttons
- No public PDF links
- Documents are for direct, human conversations only
- Reference is subtle and professional

---

## IP Exposure Verification

### ✅ No IP Exposed

**What the documents contain:**
- Conceptual descriptions of what TVI measures (temporal validation, durability, signal vs noise)
- High-level methodology descriptions (no computation details)
- Use case descriptions
- Licensing requirements and terms
- Strategic positioning

**What the documents explicitly state is NOT included:**
- Formula disclosure
- Weights or normalization logic
- Era coefficients
- Domain-specific adjustments
- Classification thresholds
- Raw datasets
- Computation logic

**What the documents do NOT contain:**
- Actual TVI formula structure
- SRC calculation methods
- CSI computation details
- TVS calculation logic
- Any code, algorithms, or mathematical implementations
- Specific thresholds or coefficients

**Conclusion:** Both documents are IP-safe. They describe TVI conceptually and commercially without exposing any protected computation logic, formulas, or implementation details.

## PDF Conversion Instructions

The HTML files are styled for PDF export. To convert to PDF:

1. **Option 1: Browser Print to PDF** (Recommended)
   - Open `TVI_Evaluation_Overview.html` in a browser
   - Print → Save as PDF
   - **Rename to:** `TVI_Evaluation_Overview_v1.pdf`
   - Repeat for `TVI_Commercial_Licensing_Notes.html`
   - **Rename to:** `TVI_Commercial_Licensing_Notes_v1.pdf`

2. **Option 2: Command Line (wkhtmltopdf)**
   ```bash
   wkhtmltopdf TVI_Evaluation_Overview.html TVI_Evaluation_Overview_v1.pdf
   wkhtmltopdf TVI_Commercial_Licensing_Notes.html TVI_Commercial_Licensing_Notes_v1.pdf
   ```

3. **Option 3: Online Converter**
   - Use any HTML to PDF converter service
   - Ensure print media queries are respected
   - **Rename outputs** to include `_v1` suffix

**Important:** When exporting PDFs for distribution, use versioned filenames:
- `TVI_Evaluation_Overview_v1.pdf`
- `TVI_Commercial_Licensing_Notes_v1.pdf`

This signals institutional seriousness and version control. HTML filenames in repo remain unchanged.

## Positioning Achieved

The documents position TVI as:
- ✅ **Valuable:** Research-grade, authoritative, commercially serious
- ✅ **Defensible:** Clear IP boundaries, patent-pending status emphasized
- ✅ **Scarce:** Evaluation access only, no self-serve, licensing required for use
- ✅ **Acquirable:** Strategic positioning, integration-focused, acquisition-ready language

---

## Next Steps for Deployment

1. Convert HTML files to PDF using preferred method
2. Store PDFs securely (not publicly accessible)
3. Send PDFs only in direct, human conversations
4. Track which organizations receive which document
5. Use Evaluation Overview for initial inquiries
6. Use Commercial & Licensing Notes for serious commercial discussions
